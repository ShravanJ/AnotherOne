Let DJ Khaled inspire us all

#What is this?
AnotherOne is a simple Java program that opens a inpirational DJ Khaled youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GasdhXLXYA) in the default web browser

#How do I run it?
From the command line just run java AnotherOneTester or import it into your favorite IDE and run it from there.

#How can I implement this in a program?
You can drop the entire AnotherOneClass into the directory that contains the other source files and create a AnotherOne object to call it and open the web page. Or you can just copy the implementation into a void method and call it if you don't want to have an extra class.
